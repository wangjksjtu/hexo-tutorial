# Hexo-Tutorial

This repository contains some brief and useful tutorials for Hexo.

## Hexo
Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in Markdown (or other languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds. You can visit the official website [here](https://hexo.io).

From my perspective, I think hexo is very convenient and easy to practice(modify and deploy), which means that you can set up an elegant website in a few minutes. That's also the reason why I highly recommend Hexoï¼Ž

My personal station is set up using Hexo. I just use yelee theme and configure the template for a few hours. You can check  it [here](https://www.wangjksjtu.com.cn/). In fact, you can create more beautiful or cleaner website if you want.

## Purpose
I have found that there are few clean but useful and practical tutorials for hexo. This repo will be composed of example-tutorial. I will write some brief but useful examples. Beginners to hexo can learn a lot, including basic usages and some tricks, from these posts.

## To Do
- Hexo basic usages
- Theme Introduction (next and yelee)
- Deployment Practice (Local or Github Pages)
- MathJax basic reference
- FQA

## Building
This repository will be updated when I am free. I promise that I will finish the basic tutorials for hexo (such as basic introduction of hexo and mathjax) as soon as possible. If you are interested in this work, I will be glad to invite you to join me. You can create or modify tutorials by fork this repo then send pull request.
